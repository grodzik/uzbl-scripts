download.sh
    Copy the download.sh to $XDG_DATA_HOME/uzbl/scripts/
    In the Uzbl config file set:

        set download_handler   = spawn @scripts_dir/download.sh

    This script gets the name of a file from headers send by server
    After download it notifies about finiszed download via notify-send (which
    uses libnotify).

    In the script you ca set the $dest variable to directory where download
    script should save downloaded files.

eFormFiller:
    Copy the eFormFiller.sh to $XDG_DATA_HOME/uzbl/scripts/
    In the Uzbl config file add bindings(for example):


        set eFormFiller = spawn @scripts_dir/eFormFiller.sh
        @bind    za        = @eFormFiller add
        @bind    ze        = @eFormFiller edit
        @bind    zn        = @eFormFiller new
        @bind    zl        = @eFormFiller load
        

    scripts_dir is set by default in uzbl config

    If NEW action is taken, then the script will generate 
    new file with formfields for current domain or will
    overrite existing one.

    EDIT action will call an editor (configure it in the script) 
    with curent domain profiles

    ADD action add another profile to current domain. Remember to name
    the profiles, by default the have a name with random numbers

    LOAD will load formfields or if there is more then one profile, it will
    call dmenu first to choose the profile you want to fill in the form

Enjoy
